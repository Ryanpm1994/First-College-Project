                        <h5>Reasons for learning a new language</h5>
                    	<p class="content_text_1">It has already been established that children who learn a language when they are very young have a much better chance of not having a “foreign” accent when speaking another language. Research from a team at the University of Washington, which focuses specifically on childhood speech perception, has noted that as we get older, it is harder to pick up additional languages with native-like pronunciation.</p> 
                        
                        <p>Thus, one very compelling reason to start children off with another language at a young age is to give them the gift of a native accent!</p>

                    	<p class="content_text_1">Young children have the opportunity for exposure and input from many different influences: parents, teachers, peers, and extended family. When both teacher and parent are on board with language learning, then children can be given language exposure, support and interaction all day long.</p> <p>A teacher can introduce words and songs in class while the parent further reinforces what was learned by offering activities and language exposure at home through CDs, bilingual books, games, videos and more.</p> <p> Plus, young children don’t have to deal with the difficulties of self-motivation that high school students or adults face when trying to learn a new language!</p><p>The wonderful thing about young children is that they will give things a try without necessarily worrying if it is correct or not.</p> <p>This applies to language learning as well. Young children will often jump right in to try out what they have learned without worrying about mistakes.</p><p>They are eager to see the response they will get from other students and adults.</p>

                <div class="content_1">
                    	<p class="content_text_1">Although most of us in the United States don’t start learning additional languages until middle school or college, for some time now studies have shown that this is not the ideal time to begin learning new languages. In fact, recent studies are showing that the best time to pick up a new language is when we are very young. Rather than causing linguistic disorders or difficulties (as was once believed), being exposed to additional languages from birth is actually the best time to start.</p><p> Young children enjoy learning. They don’t care if an activity will improve their cognitive ability or motor skills. They just want to jump in and have a great time doing it. This same approach is true for children learning a new language.</p><p> We would never try introducing high school students to a foreign language via children’s nursery rhymes, silly songs and hand puppets while sitting in a circle on the carpet. Yet, for young children, this is actually the best way to go about it because it makes language learning so much fun. It is amazing how quickly children will pick up a new language while having fun!</p>
